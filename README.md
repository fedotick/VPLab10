# Visual Programming Lab 10 (CEITI)
Repositories with solved tasks.

## Tasks
Create a game:
1. The essence is that random images are displayed on the screen. The player must enter the answer - the name of the object depicted in the picture in English. The score of correct and incorrect answers should be kept track of. A timer should tick, with the game lasting for 60 seconds.
2. Add the ability to select the category of pictures (fruits, clothing, furniture) or all.
3. Add a `ProgressBar` displaying the remaining time.
4. Add the ability to save statistics to a file - date, name, number of correct answers, and number of incorrect answers.
5. Display statistics in the form of a diagram.

## Launch
1. Download the exe file: [`VPLab10.exe`](https://github.com/fedotick/VPLab10/blob/main/VPLab10/bin/Debug/net7.0-windows/VPLab10.exe).
2. In the same directory as the `VPLab10.exe` file, create a folder with your images: `img/<category>/<image>` (the filename will be the answer in the game).
3. Run the `VPLab10.exe` file.
